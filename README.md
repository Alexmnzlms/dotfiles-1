# dotfiles

Here are the dotfiles I use for my personal system.

# Repository structure

In this repo you can find my dotfiles as if the repo root is ~ in my personal system, except for the (not yet here) `bin` folder.

# bin folder

The `bin` folder is a folder with two simple scripts:

- `deploy.sh`: Deploy the dotfiles in this repo to the system.
- `pull.sh`: Pull the dotfiles of the system in this repo.

As this repo is for personal usage, the scripts only pull and deploy the tracked files.

# Tracked files

- `nvidia_optimus` : personal script to exec arguments under nvidia card - for nvidia hybrid systems
- `.zshrc` : configuration file for zsh
- `.vimrc` : configuration file for Vim
- `.config/i3/config` : configuration file for i3
